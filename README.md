# UML Diagrams – System Analysis Examples
- This repository presents UML behavioral diagrams developed during system analysis and software design activities
- It includes Activity, Sequence, and State Machine diagrams
- The examples demonstrate how to model backend workflows, component interactions, and object lifecycles using industry-standard UML notation

### OVERVIEW

**[UML Activity Diagram](https://github.com/edmnikolaeva/uml_diagrams/blob/main/uml_activity.jpg)**
- Context: User registration in an online bookstore
- Step-by-step backend workflow for creating a *User* after the “Register” action
- It details validations and checks the backend service must perform before persisting the user in the database

**[UML Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/edmnikolaeva/uml_diagrams/blob/main/uml_sequence.jpg)**
- Context: New feature implementation for a streaming service
- End-to-end interaction sequence for filtering and subsequent sorting of movies and TV shows
- Illustrates message flow between system components involved in the feature implementation

**[UML State Machine Diagram](https://github.com/edmnikolaeva/uml_diagrams/blob/main/uml_state_machine.jpg)**
- Context: Application development for a network of medical clinics
- Lifecycle of a “Doctor Appointment” object, including key states and transitions throughout the appointment journey
